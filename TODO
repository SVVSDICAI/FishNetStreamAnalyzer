1. Get the repo update script to write to the icai repo (NEVERMIND Repo got taken down for some reason)
TODO: setup timestamp db on this pi, and have it write to that instead of github like a normal person
2. Change the model to output json (DONE)
3. Get the program to run on boot along with bringin up the stream to take screenshots (have it ping twitch first to make sure that it can be reached)
